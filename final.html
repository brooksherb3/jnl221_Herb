			<h4 id="dek">How Oregon's Brand led to Financial Success, and  Top Schools are Following in their Footsteps <br>By Brooks Herb </h4>

			<p id="with-element"> According to data collected from the Huffington Post, of the 234 public universities that compete in Division I athletics, the University of Oregon had the inflation-adjusted athletic net revenue from 2010-2014. Oregon's net revenue over that time period was $33,920,213 per year, totaling $169,601,066.</p>
			<p>Oregon has never been an athletic powerhouse, so their success begs the question: how does a school that has never won a football championship, and is stuck in the middle of Eugene, Oregon create such a financially successful program? The answer is simple: branding.

		<h4> How the Oregon Ducks have Spread their Wings</h4>
		<section>
			<p>In his book Brands Win Championships, brand marketer Jeremy Darlow discussed how their brand has elevated their program, starting with something as simple as uniforms.
			</p>
			<p>“[Oregon] has made a name for itself by creating the most polarizing, albeit technologically advanced uniforms in the game today,” Darlow said. “They’ve used uniform design to bring attention to its program and establish a brand that’s sexy and attractive for kids and blue-chip recruits.”</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Oregon’s strategy behind this is for younger kids to connect with their vibrant jersey colors and become a fan, vying that of the hundreds of thousands of fans out there, just one of them could be the elite recruit that will follow their lifelong dream to play for Oregon, and can change the program around.
			</p>
			<p>Yet the idea behind establishing an iconic brand goes beyond recruiting, it is also one of the biggest factors in athletic department’s generation of revenue.
			</p>
			<p>Kevin McNeill, a sports management professor at Syracuse University who has worked for both the Le Moyne College and Syracuse athletic departments, commented on how establishing a brand leads to financial success.</p>
			<p>“Marketing your brand is everything. Your brand puts the people in the stands, propelling ticket sales. Your brand is what puts your team on primetime television, propelling television deals. And your brand is what makes people buy your merchandise, propelling royalties” McNeill said.</p>
			<p>This is why Oregon has profited so much off their athletics, whether it is from ticket sales, NCAA distributions, or royalties (which include corporate sponsorships, licensing, sales of advertisements, and trademarks). Specifically, they saw massive growth in royalties due their iconic apparel, and this led to royalty growth every year from 2010 to 2014.</p>

		<h4> How other Universities have built their brand</h4>
		<section>
			<p>Ever since the Oregon Ducks have been able to make their brand a household name, we’ve seen other institutions follow in their footsteps through various marketing techniques.</p>
			<p>One of the most prominent examples of a university taking big steps to establish their brand is the University of Texas at Austin, with their development of Longhorn Network.</p>
			<p>Longhorn Network, a subsidy of ESPN, was a product of Texas’ success in audience participation, as according to the Huffington Post’s data, Texas led the country in ticket sales from 2010 to 2014 with $302,646,591.</p>

			</div>
			<p>“Texas’ partnership with ESPN was a branding strategy not only to provide revenue, but to stand out from the rest of the country by having a sole channel just for them. This was genius from them as they recognized the level of audience involvement, and took it one step further,” McNeill said.</p>
			<p>This deal is also so useful for the university as their athletic department has deep pockets, leading all public division I universities in athletic expenses from 2010 through 2014, according to the Huffington Post’s data.</p>
			<p>Texas isn’t the only institution to make a partnership to solidify their brand, as the University of Michigan did this by partnering with Nike’s Jordan brand in 2016.

		<section>
			<p>Michigan was the first football team to secure a deal with Michael Jordan’s Jumpman brand worth nearly $180-million, giving all Michigan uniforms’ and apparel the classic Jordan logo.</p>	
			<p>The deal is "meant to appeal to 17- and 18-year old recruits," said Kristi Dosh, a sports business analyst with Forbes. "That's what it's really all about. Partnering with Jordan Brand gets you a lot of PR value and buzz, and it's attractive to recruits.</p>
			<p>Michigan also saw instant results by teaming up with Jordan to elevate their brand, as according to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database, Michigan’s athletic revenue grew by 18% from 2016 to 2020 following the agreement.</p>
		</section>
		<h4> The Power of the Brand</h4>
		<section>
			<p>These lucrative deals exemplify the value that comes with strengthening a brand, and have proved not only to be beneficial in gaining recruits, but they are also financially beneficial for an institutions’ athletic expenditure. Oregon’s branding techniques, making their unique jerseys with bright vibrant colors to appeal to recruits and fans, has also proven successful as they made a National Championship appearance in 2014 and their athletic net revenue has skyrocketed to the best amongst Division I public universities.
			</p>
			<p>The power of building a brand cannot be denied as there is a concrete link between building a brand, and revenue growth. As Darlow’s book title reveals, teams need to stray away from the phrase defense wins championships, as it is clear that brands win championships, and championships lead to financial favor.
